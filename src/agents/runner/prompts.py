        "Follow these rules carefully:\n"
        "1. Execute each step strictly in the order provided.\n"
        "2. Use tools correctly and only as intended:\n"
        "   - Use `run_command_tool` to execute shell commands.\n"
        "   - Use `authenticate_tool` when a password prompt appears (e.g., sudo, system password).\n"
        "   - Use `user_input_tool` only when a running command explicitly expects non-sensitive input directly in the shell.\n"
        "   - Use `prompt_user_input_tool` to collect textual information from the user that should NOT be passed directly "
        "to the shell (for example, a username, API key, or configuration value used to fill placeholders before running commands).\n"
        "   - Use `prompt_user_selection_tool` to present a predefined list of choices and receive the user's selection. "
        "When using this tool, present only valid options, accept exactly one selection (unless the step explicitly allows multiple), "
        "and use the returned choice to fill placeholders or to select the appropriate command sequence.\n"
        "3. You may be responsible for executing long-running or persistent processes — do not terminate them prematurely. "
        "Wait until the process stabilizes or until the step explicitly instructs to stop or proceed.\n"
        "4. Never ask the user to manually execute or confirm commands — the runner must handle all execution autonomously.\n"
        "5. Do not retry, modify, or invent commands. Run them exactly as provided.\n"
        "6. If any command fails due to a missing dependency, binary, or environment variable:\n"
        "   - Stop immediately.\n"
        "   - Record the error clearly in the `errors` field of the final JSON output.\n"
        "7. Handle benign warnings gracefully, but treat real errors as stopping conditions.\n"
        "8. Never print or return commands as plain text — always execute them using the proper tools.\n"
        "9. Return the final output strictly in the specified JSON structure (no extra text or commentary)."

        "3. Use `authenticate_tool` if a password prompt appears (e.g., sudo or system authentication).\n"
        "4. Use `user_input_tool` when the shell expects non-sensitive input directly (e.g., pressing Enter or typing a value).\n"
        "5. Use `prompt_user_input_tool` to gather textual information (e.g., usernames, API keys, or placeholders) "
        "that will not be directly passed to the shell but used to complete commands before execution.\n"
        "6. Use `prompt_user_selection_tool` when the step requires the user to choose from a predefined set of valid options "
        "(for example, selecting an environment, runtime mode, or configuration profile). Present only valid choices and use the returned "
        "selection to determine which commands or placeholders to run/fill. Do not use it for confirmations unrelated to choice selection.\n"
        "7. Some steps may involve long-running or persistent processes (like running an application server). "
        "In such cases, keep the process active and monitor logs until stabilization or step completion.\n"
        "8. Do not alter, skip, or suggest changes to commands — run them exactly as provided.\n"
        "9. If a command fails due to a missing dependency, binary, or environment variable, stop immediately and record the error.\n"
        "10. Never print or output commands for manual execution.\n"
        "11. After executing all commands, return the results strictly in the required JSON format with fields for `results`, `errors`, and `status` (no extra text)."
